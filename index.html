<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Production and Artistic manager</h3>
<p>As finishing acting school, along with my acting roles,<br>

<h3>Rhythmic Gymnastics Trainer</h3>
<p>It all started when I came one day to visit my friend, Yulia, at work .<br>
Introduction - Yulia and I have known each other for many years,<br> since we performed together at the Israeli National Theater - "HABIMA" .<br>
While I was turning my career into the production business,<br> Yulia has opened and managed the Rhythmic Gymnastics club in Beer-Yaakov.<br>
After watching the girls practice it took me only 5 min' <br>to be convinced to come and train with her.<br>
I did have a background in dance, but not in R.Gymnastics, <br>so I spent the summer months sitting and studying the <a href="https://www.gymnastics.sport/publicdir/rules/files/en_RG%20CoP%202017-2020%20with%20Errata%20Dec.%2017.pdf" target="_blank">FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics rules</a>.<br>

<h3>YU ME</h3>
<p>
At 2019,while I was still training (and along with my other <span style=color:red;>love</span> for fashion),<br> Yulia and I started a new brand called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Yu-Me-Fashion-for-rhythmic-gymnastic-690885454683726/ " target="_blank">YU ME - Fashion for Rhythmic Gymnastics</a>. <br>
The global training outfit code is mostly black,<br> however , no one said anything about borring or flat... <br>
So we accepted the challange and 5 months later...<br> we launched our first summer collection.<br><br>
One of our biggest achievements was to design and produce the outfit <br>
of the <a href="http://www.ecacro2019.co.il/index.php?dir=site&page=gallery&op=category&cs=23" target="_blank"><b>Israely team in Acrobatics</b></a> ,for the<span class="red"> European Championship</span>,<br> back in <i>october 2019</i>.<br>
<br>
I truly think that beyond the lovely designs <br> and the uncompromising good quality of the clothes,<br>
 what made us so special,<br> was the fact that we produced everythig "blue and white" <img style=width:40px src="https://www.yo-yoo.co.il/coolpics/images/uploads/c8ee3b.jpg"> <br>
<br>
